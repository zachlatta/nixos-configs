# Configuration to passthrough my Nvidia GPU to a Windows VM.
#
# Current problems:
#
# - Need to restart scream in user environment for sound to start coming
#   through (maybe it's starting after the wrong service?)
#
# - Nvidia GPU fan runs at 100% when passed through
#
# - Potential Looking Glass shared RAM permissions issue - should double check this
